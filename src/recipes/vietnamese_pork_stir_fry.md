## **Instructions**

1. Heat oil on high heat
2. Add the onion, garlic, chili and cumin.
    - Cook for 2 mins
3. Add the pork and break it apart while you cook for 2mins
4. Mix fish sauce and sugar into a container
    - If the mix is too sweet, you may add the soy sauce
5. Pour a bit of the mix into the pan
    - Let simmer for 1min without touching
    - Stir, add more mix and wait 30s to a minute
    - Repeat until no more sauce or reached desired taste
6. Serve it alongside your desired side.

I usually just add rice to the pan and cook it a bit more so the rice can acquire the taste of the meat and the mix.
